    <h1>Who I am</h1>
    <p>I am a senior at Mizzou studying Computer Science and Information Technology. I am interested in front-end development and user interface. I am interested in how people interact with technology and how developers can make that process more enjoyable for the user. When I started college I was a psychology major, so I use the knowledge I gained in those classes and apply it to my computer science projects.</p>
    <p>I really enjoy solving problems and being challenged. I initally became interested in computer science as a senior in high school because I took a web page design course. When I started college I was a Psychology major, but I switched to Computer Science because I wanted a major where I felt challenged. I love computer science because I enjoy creating programs that can solve a problem or make someone's life easier. I also like that the field is constantly changing and there is always something new to learn.</p>
