    <h1>Who I am</h1>
    <p>I am a senior at Mizzou studying Computer Science and Information Technology. I am interested in many aspect of the CS field:</p>
    <p>I am interested in project management because I can apply my skills in organization, leadership, planning and technicial to create a detailed plan for a project and oversee its completion. Using these skills I can manage a project based on scope, resources, time and money.</p>
    <p>I am also interested in front-end development and user interface. I am interested in how people interact with technology and how developers can make that process more enjoyable for the user. When I started college I was a psychology major, so I use the knowledge I gained in those classes and apply it to my computer science projects.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I really enjoy solving problems and being challenged. I initally became interested in computer science as a senior in high school when I took a web page design course. When I started college I was a psychology major, but I switched to computer science after learning about the wide range of job opportunities. I love computer science because I enjoy creating programs that can solve problems or make someone's life easier. I also like that the field is constantly changing and there is always something new to learn.</p>
